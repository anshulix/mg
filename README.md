# TableCreator

Basic Implementation

## Installation

1. Download repo
2. Open index.html in browser

## Usage

All functions are called inside start function
CreateTable(global.mgTableData);
FilterOnCity('Delhi');
FilterOnCity('Mumbai');
SortTable();

Comment any of it and see how they work.

## Issues
Huge scope of improvement, it is time limited implementation to showcase functionality. I'd not use any of the code in live production website.
